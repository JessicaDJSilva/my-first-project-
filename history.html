                    During the period of colonization by Portugal the country was first tasked with the exportation of
                    sugar cane, and then after that gold up until Portugal was threatened by the Napoleonic and Spanish
                    empires causing the Monarchy to flee to Brazil and establish a joint Brazilian/Portuguese nation
                    before shortly afterwards Brazil fighting for independence and ultimately securing it around 1800AD.

                <p>
                    After Brazil obtained independence there was a period of instability in which the countries ruling
                    powers switched between Civilian control and Military control until a period of political stability
                    was
                    declared around 2004, after which the country has prospered economically and socially, with
                    continued growth, even becoming the most economically successful nation in South America, and 9th in
                    world.

                    Brazil's official name is actually the Federative Republic of Brazil, and Brazil means “red as
                    ember”,
                    as
                    well as its origin comes from the tree Pau Brazil, which has a reddish color. And one of the
                    curiosities
                    about Brazil that almost no one knows is that about 100 years ago the country was called the United
                    States of Brazil.

                    Brazil has a long a rich history, it hosts some of the earliest remains of humans ever found on the
                    American continent – the Luiza Woman. There is also pottery found in the rainforests that suggest a
                    complex cultural centre up to 8000 years ago! This culture continued up until the Portuguese empire
                    arrived in 1500AD.
