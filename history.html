            <p>
                During the period of colonization by Portugal the country was first tasked with the exportation of
                sugar cane, and then after that gold up until Portugal was threatened by the Napoleonic and Spanish
                empires causing the Monarchy to flee to Brazil and establish a joint Brazilian/Portuguese nation
                before shortly afterwards Brazil fighting for independence and ultimately securing it around 1800AD.

        <div>
            <p>
                After Brazil obtained independence there was a period of instability in which the countries ruling
                powers switched between Civilian control and Military control until a period of political stability was
                declared around 2004, after which the country has prospered economically and socially, with
                continued growth, even becoming the most economically successful nation in South America, and 9th in
                world.

                Brazil official name is actually the Federative Republic of Brazil, and Brazil means “red as ember”, as
                well as its origin comes from the tree Pau Brazil, which has a reddish color. And one of the curiosities
                about Brazil that almost no one knows is that about 100 years ago the country was called the United
                States of Brazil.
