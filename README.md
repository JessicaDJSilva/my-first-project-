## Features
#### Navigation Bar
The website features a navigation bar that lets the user navigate around the different pages using a responsive layout that shapes based on the users screen size. The bar is clearly outlining which page that it takes the user to, and the current page is highlighted in  a darker green which shows the user what screen they are currently on. This colour also fits with the overall theme of the website (the brazillian national colours of green).
The user can also press the website name on the left to navigate back to the home page if they wish to.

## Bugs
- The images were too low big for small screens when testing, so a animage was added for smaller screens with a different dimension.
- The link that i used for the images didn't work originally due to a space in the name, this was fixed by renaming the images and the references.
- The image was affecting the website performance on lighthouse so I changed the file from jpeg to webp using an online converter.
